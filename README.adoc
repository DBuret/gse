== Introduction 

GSE is a small standalone web app designed to help debugging the environment of orchestred containers, through a very small go app.

It can be be easly packaged into a < 3 MB docker image that will run with less than 20 Mo of ram, making it easly to deploy.

.It offers 4 endpoints
* displays its env and the details of the http request it received
** usefull to understand what env and request your containers receive
* display its version in a single line of text
* healthcheck that can also be turned in ok or ko state through a simple http call
** usefull to play with your container orchestrator (kubernetes, nomad...) routing system.
* logger tonoutput what you want on the log output
** usefull to test your that log gathering system

WARNING: This was my first attempt as golang. Quick'n Dirty, but this tool has been proven usefull during our journey with Nomad or Kube...

== Endpoints

GSE offers 4 end points

=== Display environment

* `/gse` endpoint can be queried through any HTTP method (GET, PUT, ...). It will answer an HTTP 200 status, with an HTML content displaying information about the HTTP request received
** headers
** hostname
** path
** POST/PUT/... parameters
* note that this endpoint will write a one line log to stdout
* `/gse` can be changed to another path via the `GSE_BASEPATH` pararameter. Other endpoints (version, healthcheck) will inherit this parameters.

=== Display version & stamp
* `/gse/version` endpoint can be queried through any HTTP method (GET, PUT, ...). It will answer an HTTP 200 status,with a single text line content made of program version and its stamp (if one has been specified, default stamp being empty) 
* the "stamp" allows us to test rolling, blue/green, or canary update with our container orchestrator: the same docker image (=same version) can be run with a given stamp (see GSE_STAMP bellow) given as parameter by the orchestrator, so we can differenciate to deployments, exemple:
** with no stamp, the answer will be `3.0`
** with GSE_STAMP="A",  the answer will be `3.0A`


=== Healthcheck
* `/gse/health` is a endpoint to be used as healthcheck through an HTTP `GET` query. Answer will be 
** when healtcheck is on: HTTP 200 status, content will be the text string _I'm alive_ 
** when healthcheck is off: HTTP 503 status, content will be the text string _I'm sick_ 
** no log will be written to stdout
* healthcheck can be switched on/off (flip/flop) with an access with HTTP `POST` or `PUT` methods:
*** `curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:28657/gse/health`
*** `curl -X PUT http://127.0.0.1:28657/gse/health`
*** note that `POST` or `PUT` access to this endpoint writes log to stdout:

    healthcheck has been switched to false
    healthcheck has been switched to true

=== logger
WARNING: This endpoint is not activated by default since input sanitization is crappy. Use at your own risk

*  `/gse/logger` is an HTTP `POST` endpoint that will write to stdout the payload of the POST request
* answer: HTTP 200 status, content will be the text string _data ingested._ 

== Parameters

GSE accepts some parameters, either through command line flags or env vars. 

.GSE parameters
[cols="3,^1,^1,^1,^1"]
|===
| parameter | env var name | cli name | type |default value 

| path in the url (note: impacts all endpoints)| `GSE_BASEPATH` | `-basepath` |string | `/gse`

| tcp port to listen to | `GSE_PORT` | `-port` | int  | `28657`

| stamp added to version endpoint | `GSE_STAMP`| `-stamp` | string | empty

| set healthcheck answer to HTTP 200 or HTTP 503 | `GSE_HEALTHCHECK` | `-healthcheck` | boolean | `true`

| activate logger endpoint | `GSE_LOGGER` | `-logger` | boolean | `false`


|===

.We also have the standard -h cli arg
[source,console]
----
$ ./gse -h
----

Since we use https://github.com/namsral/flag to parse arguments, they can be fed either through command line or env vars. 

CAUTION: flag parsing when value is `/...` seems to be bugged on windows. You cannot change the basepath on gse if you run on windows.


== Compile

Goal is to create a small but standalone binary to allow us to build a small container image. 

.Build with static linking so we can Dockerfile FROM scratch
[source,console]
----
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -tags netgo -ldflags "-s -w" .
----

The resulting binary should be < 9 Mb. 

TIP: If that's too big, you can use upx to reduce file size to ~ 2.5 Mb

.Run
[source,console]
----
$ ./gse
----

point your web browser to http://localhost:28657/gse 

== Create docker image

the following is a multi stage docker build.
first we compile and compress executable in the _builder_ stage, then we create an image `FROM scratch'

.Dockerfile
[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM devalias/upx:devel AS upx

FROM golang AS builder
COPY --from=upx /usr/bin/upx /usr/bin/upx
WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/DBuret/gse
RUN go get -d -v github.com/namsral/flag
COPY gse.go .
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -a -tags netgo -ldflags "-s -w" .
RUN  /usr/bin/upx --brute gse

FROM scratch
LABEL version="4.1"
LABEL link="https://github.com/DBuret/gse"
LABEL description="Go Show Env - micro HTTP service to help understanding container orchestrators environment"
WORKDIR /
COPY --from=builder /go/src/github.com/DBuret/gse .
ADD template.html .

CMD ["/gse"]
----

.Build image 
[source,console]
----
$ sudo docker build -t gse .
----

== Run locally with docker

=== Using default config
[source,console]
----
$ sudo docker run -p 28657:28657 gse
----

point your web browser to http://localhost:28657/gse 

=== using parameters
[source,console]
----
$ sudo docker run -e GSE_BASEPATH=/foo -e GSE_PORT=2000 -e GSE_STAMP=A -e GSE_HEALTHCHECK=false -e GSE_LOGGER=true -p 2000:2000 gse
----

.Point your web browser to
* http://localhost:2000/foo 
* http://localhost:2000/foo/version
* http://localhost:2000/foo/health

.Set healthcheck endpoint to "ok"
 $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:2000/foo/health

=== RAM usage

WARNING: gse will eat around 14 Mb of _RAM_ (even if your _file_ has been shrinked by upx, upon execution it will be uncompressed to RAM. Using upx just saves disk space and download time). When setting ressources quota to a gse container, allow 20 Mb of RAM to the container and you will be safe.
